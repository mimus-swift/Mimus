> Mimus is a bird genus in the family Mimidae. It contains the typical mockingbirds.

Mimus is a Swift mocking library, aiming to reduce boilerplate code required for building mocks in Swift. It's been battle tested at [AirHelp](http://airhelp.com) and [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) where it's being used extensively across test suites.

# Main features:

* Pure Swift
* Protocol-oriented implementation
* Integrated with XCTest
* Support for verification of basic types and collections (including optionals)
* Support for writing custom matchers
* Detailed failure reporting
* Unit-tested

# Usage

A Mimus mock can be created by declaring a class that conforms to your custom protocol and Mimus `Mock` type:

```swift
class FakeAuthenticationManager: AuthenticationManager, Mock {

    var storage = Mimus.Storage()

    func beginAuthentication(with email: String, password: String) {
        recordCall(withIdentifier: "BeginAuthentication", arguments: [email, password])
    }
}
```

Afterwards you can verify whether specific call was received:

```swift
let fakeLoginAuthenticationManager = FakeAuthenticationManager()

(...)

fakeLoginAuthenticationManager.verifyCall(withIdentifier: "BeginAuthentication",
        arguments: [mEqual("Fixture Email"), mEqual("Fixture Password")])
```

You can find more on the basic usage [here](https://github.com/mimus-swift/Mimus/blob/master/Documentation/Basics.md).

For detailed usage refer to [documentation folder](https://github.com/mimus-swift/Mimus/tree/master/Documentation).

## Installation

### Carthage

You can also use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for installing Mimus.
Simply add it to your Cartfile:

```
github "mimus-swift/Mimus"
```

and then link it with your test target.

### Swift Package Manager

Mimus is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

- When added as a package dependency:

```
dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/mimus-swift/Mimus.git",
            from: "1.1.4"
        )
    ]
```

- When added as an Application dependency:

```
To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL.
```
```
You can also navigate to your target’s General pane, and in the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section, click the + button.
```
```
In the “Choose frameworks and libraries to add” dialog, select Add Other, and choose Add Package Dependency.
```


### Cocoapods - DEPRECATED

Mimus is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile against your test target:

```ruby
pod "Mimus"
```

Note that starting with 2.1.0 Mimus will not be distributed via Cocoapods - we're moving to Swift Package Manager and we recommend everyone to do the same. You can still use Cocoapods with latest versions by pinning to a specific tag.
